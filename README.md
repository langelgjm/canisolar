# Can I Solar?

[Can I Solar](http://www.canisolar.com) is a tool designed to help homeowners decide whether a residential solar installation might make sense for them. Given minimal inputs, it produces estimates of how much a solar installation might reduce one's bills, and how long it could take to break even after initial installation costs.

Technical details of the modeling components are available on [SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/GabrielMichael1/can-i-solar-how-it-works).

The backend is written in Python and relies on MySQL and MongoDB, while the models were developed in R.
